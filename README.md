Web Application Development AI-based question generation: https://amazing-dieffenbachia-fc81bc.netlify.app
Used Software Refactoring & Code Smells Dataset
In my project, I created an AI to generate quiz questions about refactoring and code smells. This application will help users generate quiz questions for educational purposes in software engineering training and assessment. I also created my own dataset as a CSV file containing 650 rows, which generates the keywords for questions and answers about Software Engineering Specific Refactoring and Code Smells.
